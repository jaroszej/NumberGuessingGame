# NumberGuessingGame
 2018 school project to learn java with jframe

The goals of this project were to experiment with jframe to develop a very simple UI as well as develop a simple game using java.

The user is meant to enter a number which serves as the maximum number the program will guess. Then the user, mentally, will choose a number for the program to "guess".
The program produces a number in the middle of the input range and then takes input "higher" or "lower" or "correct" to determine what number to guess next or if the game is over.
When the game is over, a popup displays several different text responses from the bear character in the game.
